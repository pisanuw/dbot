Borenstein	http://www.devtopics.com/101-more-great-computer-quotes/
Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything.  One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them.  Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space.  What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.   -- Charles M. Strauss	http://www.devtopics.com/101-more-great-computer-quotes/

How rare it is that maintaining someone else’s code is akin to entering a beautifully designed building, which you admire as you walk around and plan how to add a wing or do some redecorating. More often, maintaining someone else’s code is like being thrown headlong into a big pile of slimy, smelly garbage.   -- Bill Venners	http://www.devtopics.com/101-more-great-computer-quotes/

I didn’t work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me.  No language can be perfect for everyone.  I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it’s not perfect for you.  The perfect language for Guido van Rossum is probably Python.   -- Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka Matz, creator of Ruby	http://www.devtopics.com/101-more-great-computer-quotes/

[The study of prime numbers] becoming pivotal in cryptography and online security. As it happens, it is much easier to multiply primes together than to factor them back out. In modern encryption, secret primes known only to the sender and recipient get multiplied together to create huge composite numbers that can be transmitted publicly without fear, since factoring the product would take eavesdropper way too long to be worth attempting.   -- Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
A code, which according to Turing's schema is supposed to make one machine behave as if it were another specific machine (which is supposed to make the former imitate the latter) must do the following things. It must contain, in terms that the machine will understand (and purposively obey), instructions (further detailed parts of the code) that will cause the machine to examine every order it gets and determine whether this order has the structure appropriate to an order of the second machine. It must then contain, in terms of the order system of the first machine, sufficient orders to make the machine cause the actions to be taken that the second machine would have taken under the influence of the order in question.   -- John von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

A healthy child given enough training time can get fairly good not only at any game, but also at any language, sport or vocation. Comparing the intelligence of humans and machines today, we humans win hands-down on breadth, while machines outperform us in a small but growing number of narrow domains, as illustrated in figure 2.1. The holy grail AI research is to build general AI (better known as artificial general intelligence, AGI) that is maximally broad: able to accomplish virtually any goal, including learning.   -- Max Tegmark, Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Ensmenger	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
An algorithm must be seen to be believed.   -- Donald Knuth, Leaders in Computing: Changing the digital world	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
An international power supply is the device which means it doesn't matter what country you're in, or even if you know what country you're in (more of a problem than you might suspect) - you just plug your Mac in and it figures it out for itself. We call this principle Plug and Play. Or at least, Microsoft calls it that because it hasn't got it yet. In the Mac world we've had it for so long we didn't even think of giving it a name.   -- Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
And they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status.   -- Alec J. Ross, The Industries of the Future	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Any artificial automaton that has been constructed for human use, and specifically for the control of complicated processes, normally possesses a purely logical part and an arithmetical part, i.e. a part in which arithmetical processes play no role, and one in which they are of importance.   -- John von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Artificial intelligence is nowhere near attaining actual sentience or awareness. And without awareness it’s simply a mechanical device, which may pretend to show emotions and sentience, if it is programmed to do so, and thus it may be able to fool the humans as being alive, but in its own internal circuitry, it’d simply be following its preprogrammed tasks through the flowchart of an algorithm.   -- Abhijit Naskar	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Artificial intelligence will not destroy this planet, irresponsible human intelligence will.   -- Abhijit Naskar	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Automation vs. human labor is a false dichotomy   -- Siddharth Suri, Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
believe the power of jQuery is highly underutilized. Most developers will take advantage of its shortcuts and CSS selectors, but most of the time they fail to take advantage of much else. Being able to extend jQuery, whether by adding your own functions, CSS selectors or full-blown plugins, makes you a much stronger and smarter developer.   -- Robert Duchnik, jQuery Plugin Development In 30 Minutes	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Ciência da Computação tem tanto a ver com o computador como a astronomia com o telescópio, a biologia com o microscópio, ou a química com os tubos de ensaio. A ciência não estuda ferramentas, mas o que fazemos e o que descobrimos com elas.   -- Edsger Dijkstra	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Code is not like other how-computers-work books. It doesn't have big color illustrations of disk drives with arrows showing how the data sweeps into the computer. Code has no drawings of trains carrying a cargo of zeros and ones. Metaphors and similes are wonderful literary devices but they do nothing but obscure the beauty of technology.   -- Charles Petzold, Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Coding is not just code, that is a live thing to serve everyone!   -- Ming Song	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Computation is not the same as thought and emulation is not the same as imagination.   -- Abhijit Naskar, Mission Reality	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Computer science increasingly relies on its private corporate patrons who apply their own closed systems of peer review and criticism, with occasional results thrown over the wall. The closed walls of Redmond or Mountain View enable old-fashioned patronage of nature's secrets. The objectivity and scientific status of computer science is a chimera: we cannot stand on the shoulders of giants in computer science, for they simply refuse to let us.   -- Samir Chopra, Decoding Liberation: The Promise of Free and Open Source Software	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Computer science only indicates the retrospective omnipotence of our technologies. In other words, an infinite capacity to process data (but only data - i.e. the already given) and in no sense a new vision. With that science, we are entering an era of exhaustivity, which is also an era of exhaustion. Of generalized interactivity abolishing particularized action. Of the interface which abolishes challenge, passion, and rivalry between peoples, ideas and individuals which was always the source of the finest energies.	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Computers and mobile devices are becoming known for their inherent insecurities and the ability to damage the long term health of the users.   -- Steven Magee	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Every machine has artificial intelligence. And the more advanced a machine gets, the more advanced artificial intelligence gets as well. But, a machine cannot feel what it is doing. It only follows instructions - our instructions - instructions of the humans. So, artificial intelligence will not destroy the world. Our irresponsibility will destroy the world.   -- Abhijit Naskar	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Evolution optimizes strongly for energy efficiency because of limited food supply, not for ease of construction or understanding by human engineers.   -- Max Tegmark	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
For many purposes, we need to understand the world as having things in it that are related to each other, not just variables with values. For example, we might notice that a large truck ahead of us is reversing into the driveway of a dairy farm but a cow has got loose and is blocking the truck’s path. A factored representation is unlikely to be pre-equipped with the attribute TruckAheadBackingIntoDairyFarmDrivewayBlockedByLooseCow with value true or false   -- Stuart Russell, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Functions that create values are easier to combine in new ways than functions that directly perform side effects   -- Marijn Haverbeke	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Generating a system architecture is not a deterministic process. It requires careful consideration of business requirements, technology choices, existing infrastructure and systems, and actual physical resources, such as budget and manpower.   -- Andrew Holdsworth, Oracle9i Database Performance Planning	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

I hope the ﬁeld of computer science never loses its sense of fun. ... What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands I think and hope is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were ﬁrst led up to it, that you can make it more.   -- Alan J. Perlis, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out it was an awful lot of fun. Of course the paying customers got shafted every now and then and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them setting them off in new directions and keeping fun in the house. I hope the ﬁeld of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all I hope we don’t become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible sales-men. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands.

In my experience, requirements change quite often, or new situations will arise that weren’t anticipated at the start of the project. If the situation can be addressed with a plugin, I just whip open the standalone plugin page, make the updates and pop the new plugin back in. Because the plugin is self-contained, it’s easy to recreate the problem, fix it, and get it back into the codebase.   -- Robert Duchnik, jQuery Plugin Development In 30 Minutes	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
In search," Urs (Hölzle) believed, "the discussion was really, How can we outdistance our current system and make it look laughable?

In the history of ideas, it's repeatedly happened that an idea, developed in one area for one purpose, finds an unexpected application elsewhere. Concepts developed purely for philosophy of mathematics turned out to be just what you needed to build a computer. Statistical formulae for understanding genetic change in biology are now applied in both economics and in programming.   -- Patrick Grim	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Index design is also a largely iterative process, based on the SQL generated by application designers. However, it is possible to make a sensible start by building indexes that enforce primary key constraints and indexes on known access patterns, such as a person's name. As the application evolves and testing is performed on realistic sizes of data, certain queries will need performance improvements for which building a better index is a good solution.   -- Andrew Holdsworth, Oracle9i Database Performance Planning	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Just as functions within computer science, ecosystems must become first-class citizens in biology. First-class functions are not merely sequences of steps, but genuine entities, which can be passed as arguments to and from other functions in the same manner as other data types. Languages that support this concept have a fundamentally greater expressive power than those that relegate functions to the status of 'second-class citizens' relative to first-class 'data' objects. Biology needs an analogous expressive power in order to refer properly to the role of ecosystems as carriers of fundamental patterns, and as entities parallel to and in some ways superseding organisms.   -- Eric Smith, The Origin and Nature of Life on Earth: The Emergence of the Fourth Geosphere	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Lilah did little more than sleep and eat and cry, which to me was the most fascinating thing in the entire universe. Why did she cry? When did she sleep? What made her eat a lot one day and little the next? Was she changing with time? I did what any obsessed person would do in such a case: I recorded data, plotted it, calculated statistical correlations. First I just wrote on scraps of paper and made charts on graph paper, but I very quickly became more sophisticated. I wrote computer software to make a beautifully colored plot showing times when Diane fed Lilah, in black; when I fed her, in blue (expressed mother's milk, if you must know); Lilah's fussy times, in angry red; her happy times, in green. I calculated patterns in sleeping times, eating times, length of sleep, amounts eaten.	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Programs should always have the form of paragraphs of comments that describe the intention of the program followed by paragraphs of code that implement that intention. All of the formatting should be designed to make readers as able as possible to read the code easily; the compiler doesn’t care. In particular, follow conventions of mathematics and your native language, not those you found in some random language manual. Write the comments first and then write the code, not the other way around. If you don’t know what you want to achieve and why, any code you write is, by definition, incorrect.   -- Charles Wetherell, Etudes for Programmers	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Seemingly innocuous language like 'Oh, I'm flexible' or 'What do you want to do tonight?' has a dark computational underbelly that should make you think twice. It has the veneer of kindness about it, but it does two deeply alarming things. First, it passes the cognitive buck: 'Here's a problem, you handle it.' Second, by not stating your preferences, it invites the others to simulate or imagine them. And as we have seen, the simulation of the minds of others is one of the biggest computational challenges a mind (or machine) can ever face.   -- Brian Christian, Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Stop pushing people into web development as if it is the only true career path.

The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.   -- Donald E.

The clarity offered by software as metaphor - and the empowerment allegedly offered to us who know software - should make us pause, because software also engenders a sense of profound ignorance. Software is extremely difficult to comprehend. Who really knows what lurks behind our smiling interfaces, behind the objects we click and manipulate? Who completely understands what one’s computer is actually doing at any given moment? Software as a metaphor for metaphor troubles the usual functioning of metaphor, that is, the clarification of an unknown concept through a known one. For, if software illuminates an unknown, it does so through an unknowable (software). This paradox - this drive to grasp what we do not know through what we do not entirely understand… does not undermine, but rather grounds software’s appeal. Its combination of what can be seen and not seen, can be known and no known - it’s separation of interface from algorithm, of software from hardware - makes it a powerful metaphor for everything we believe is invisible yet generates visible effects, from genetics to the invisible hand of the market, from ideology to culture. Every use entails an act of faith.   -- Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Programmed Visions: Software and Memory 	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.   -- Edsger W. Dijkstra	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
The silicon microchips themselves might be cheap (relative to times past, anyway), but CPU cycles are not cheap. Every CPU cycle consumes clock time. Clock time is latency. A wasteful application makes its users wait longer than they need to, and if there’s anything users hate, it’s waiting. For web systems, latency in the application has a dual effect. The added processing directly increases the burden on the application servers themselves. Suppose that an application takes just 250 milliseconds of extra processing per transaction. If the system processes a million transactions a day, that extra 250 milliseconds per transaction makes for an extra 69.4 hours of compute time every day. Assuming an 80% load factor on each server, you’ll need four additional servers to handle this load.   -- Michael T. Nygard, Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
The spectacle's instruction and the spectators' ignorance are wrongly seen as antagonistic factors when in fact they give birth to each other. In the same way, the computer's binary language is an irresistible inducement to the continual and unreserved acceptance of what has been programmed according to the wishes of someone else and passes for the timeless source of a superior, impartial and total logic. Such progress, such speed, such breadth of vocabulary! Political? Social? Make your choice. You cannot have both. My own choice is inescapable. They are jeering at us, and we know whom these programs are for. Thus it is hardly surprising that children should enthusiastically start their education at an early age with the Absolute Knowledge of computer science; while they are still unable to read, for reading demands making judgements at every line; and is the only access to the wealth of pre-spectacular human experience. Conversation is almost dead, and soon so too will be those who knew how to speak.   -- Guy Debord, Comments on the Society of the Spectacle	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

The very last stage of any memory hierarchy is necessarily the outside world—that is, the outside world as far as the machine is concerned, i.e. that part of it with which the machine can directly communicate, in other words, the input and the output organs of the machine. These are usually punched paper tapes or cards, and on the output side, of course, also printed paper.   -- John von Neumann, The Computer and the Brain	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

This relation of program to environment opened up an exceedingly important role for computer simulation as a tool for achieving a deeper understanding of human behavior. For if it is the organization of components, and not their physical properties, that largely determines behavior, and if computers are organized somewhat in the image of man, then the computer becomes an obvious device for exploring the consequences of alternative organizational assumptions for human behavior. Psychology could move forward without awaiting the solutions by neurology of the problems of component design—however interesting and significant these components turn out to be.   -- Herbert A. Simon, The Sciences of the Artificial	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Ultimately, I try to think of my application’s main codebase as just stringing together various components and code from many sources. It just controls logic and flow. The real nitty-gritty is handled behind the scenes. This is why frameworks like Backbone are so important — they hide a lot of the details in the background and allow you to just focus on the flow and control of your application.   -- Robert Duchnik, jQuery Plugin Development In 30 Minutes	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology—the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is". Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to".   -- Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Unix is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly compiled oral history of the hacker subculture. It is our Gilgamesh epic: a living body of narrative that many people know by heart, and tell over and over again—making their own personal embellishments whenever it strikes their fancy. The bad embellishments are shouted down, the good ones picked up by others, polished, improved, and, over time, incorporated into the story. […] Thus Unix has slowly accreted around a simple kernel and acquired a kind of complexity and asymmetry about it that is organic, like the roots of a tree, or the branchings of a coronary artery. Understanding it is more like anatomy than physics.   -- Neal Stephenson	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
Want to guarantee nasty conflicts?

Well, writing novels is incredibly simple: an author sits down…and writes. Granted, most writers I know are a bit strange. Some, downright weird.But then again, you’d have to be. To spend hundreds and hundreds of hours sitting in front of a computer screen staring at lines of information is pretty tedious. More like a computer programmer.

When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It’s really that simple: Program, or be programmed.   -- Douglas Rushkoff, Program or Be Programmed: Ten Commands for a Digital Age	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
When the ANSI C standard was under development, the pragma directive was introduced. Borrowed from Ada, #pragma is used to convey hints to the compiler, such as the desire to expand a particular function in-line or suppress range checks. Not previously seen in C, pragma met with some initial resistance from a gcc implementor, who took the implementation-defined effect very literally—in gcc version 1.34, the use of pragma causes the compiler to stop compiling and launch a computer game instead! The gcc manual contained the following: The #pragma command is specified in the ANSI standard to have an arbitrary implementation-defined effect. In the GNU C preprocessor, #pragma first attempts to run the game rogue; if that fails, it tries to run the game hack; if that fails, it tries to run GNU Emacs displaying the Tower of Hanoi; if that fails, it reports a fatal error. In any case, preprocessing does not continue. —Manual for version 1.34 of the GNU C compiler   -- Peter van der Linden, Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
While functions being unable to change state is good because it helps us reason about our programs, there's one problem with that. If a function can't change anything in the world, how is it supposed to tell us what it calculated? In order to tell us what it calculated, it has to change the state of an output device (usually the state of the screen), which then emits photons that travel to our brain and change the state of our mind, man.   -- Miran Lipovača	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science

Worse yet is the rejection of upfront requirements. The basic observation is correct: requirements will change, and are hard anyway to capture at the beginning. In no way, however, does it imply the dramatic conclusion that upfront requirements are useless! What it does imply is that requirements should be subject to change, like all other artifacts on the software process. [...] The agile advice here is irresponsible and serious software projects should ignore it.The sound practice is to start collecting requirements at the beginning, produce a provisional version prior to engaging in design, and treat the requirements as a living product that undergoes constant adaptation throughout the project.   -- Bertrand Meyer	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
You are not reading this book because a teacher assigned it to you, you are reading it because you have a desire to learn, and wanting to learn is the biggest advantage you can have.   -- Cory Althoff, The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally	https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/computer-science
